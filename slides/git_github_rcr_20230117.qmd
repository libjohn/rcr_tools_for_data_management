## Version control

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}

- Manage how computers files change over time

## git 

- Git is one of the most popular.   
- Free open-source application
- Scalable - works with any size project
    - Linux is a world-wide project, spanning time-zones and languages
- Git is a **file** repository, or repo
- Git and GitHub are not the same thing.  Symbiotic cousins

## Track project directories 

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}

\
<br/>

- Tell the story of your project
- Who, What, and When files change.  (and Why, How)

## Jargon

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="70%"}

**Commit** - ascribe the WWWWH values to the storyline

- In this way we 
    - Can tell the story of our project
    - Time-travel – rolling-back to an earlier state of the entire project

## Experiment

\


:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="60%"}

- Through a feature called a branch
- Make replica copies of the git repo
- Alter and experiment 
- Merge (or delete) the branch
- dev/prod

::: {.column width="40%"}

## File types

- Any computer file
- In practice:  text documents and scripts work best
    - HTML, CSS, Markdown, SVG files, CSV files,
- Voluminous files 
    - Can be managed with adjacent processes (databases, or other)
    - Administrative overhead is always a concern:  KISS
- Final documents, posters etc
    - Although, reproducible best practice implies deriving reports from code.

## Profile and Share

- Remotes are shared/distributed via Hubs (GitHub, GitLab, BitBucket)
    - Distribution, Collaboration, Project Management, Pull-Request, etc.


- Other hubs already mentioned
    - but also Duke’s instance:  gitlab.oit.duke.edu

## GitHub - file distribution ++

- A place to store and host git repositories

- More than a repo host
  - VMs 
  - Project management
      - Access control, task lists, bug tracking, wiki documentation, Kanban planning
      
## GitHub - mini case study

- Clone my repo (or Fork) [difference? permissions!]
- My repo is public
- Code collaboration via Pull-Requests
- Repo editor resolves PRs
- Via version (or releases). Can synchronize **file repo** with **archival repo** for milestones such as an accepted article
